        As all great things do, Pat's Salmon Cookie Co. started off as a simple series of questions: is it possible to make cookies out of fish? If it is, wil they be good? Will anyone want to go out of their way to pay money to eat them? These questions all bounced around in the head of local businessman Pat Sherwood, and lived in there long enough to become a fully fledged idea. Now, Pat's Salmon Cookie Co. is a brand new business launching with several locations! If you are interested in having your entire perception of whether or not a salmon cookie would be even a remotely good idea, then stop by one of our stores and prepare for a complete paradigm shift of what the word 'cookie' is even supposed to mean.
